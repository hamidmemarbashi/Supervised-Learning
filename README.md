# Supervised-Learning
In this project, "Telecom Churn" dataset is used to develop and select the best model to predict the customer churn.

This project is started with exploratory data analysis, followed up with data processing and feature engineering. Then, seven supervised learning models were designed and their performances were compared to select the best model to predict the customer churn. Lastly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was implemented to increase the models' performance.
